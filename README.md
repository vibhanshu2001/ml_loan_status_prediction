# ml_loan_status_prediction
The loan status prediction model is developed using various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, re, NLTK, scikit-learn, and Seaborn.

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for numerical computation, and re for regular expression operations. NLTK is used for natural language processing, including the removal of stop words and stemming of words, while TfidfVectorizer is used for feature extraction and transformation of text data.

The scikit-learn library is used for model selection, training, and evaluation. The Logistic Regression algorithm is used for the classification of loan status, and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used for comparison. The accuracy score metric is used for evaluating the performance of the model, which is 83.33%.

Finally, the Seaborn library is used for visualization purposes.
